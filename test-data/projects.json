The Woodland BushBids project will be implemented across this area. The eastern section of the Woodland BushBids project area contains large areas of woodland and mallee woodland where habitat quality could be improved through management. The western section contains smaller areas of priority woodland types in a largely cleared landscape. Protection and enhancement of native vegetation is necessary for the conservation of vegetation corridors through the region as well as management of woodland types such as Black Oak Woodlands. Management of native vegetation will also assist the protection of threatened species such as the Carpet Python, Regent Parrot, Bush Stone Curlew and the endangered Hopbush, Dodonea subglandulifera and will provide habitat for significant species such as the Southern Hairy Nosed Wombat. Woodland BushBids will assist landholders to provide management services to protect and enhance native vegetation quality.",

        "description": "This project has been developed as a partnership between the Birchip Cropping Group (BCG) and Mallee Catchment Management Authority (MCMA) to facilitate improvements in the connectivity and resilience of native vegetation. The costs and risks involved in undertaking revegetation works are often prohibitive, particularly in low rainfall areas such as the Victorian Mallee, where the success of revegetation can be low. This project seeks to address some of these barriers by assessing whether incorporating degradable polymers with mixed seed increases seed germination and survival rates in the Mallee, making revegetation more cost-effective. Four trial sites will be established to evaluate the efficacy of using such polymers in direct seeding.",

A second large infestation has recently been discovered. It has been observed that these large infestations are killing native tree species and swarming understory species.rn Despite work by the trust Ranger and volunteers to curb this weed, the infestations are spreading rapidly with small outbreaks being found further afield within the reserve. This area includes along Creek lines and the Macquarie River. Control efforts by the trust and trust Ranger alone are not sufficient to bring bridal creeper infestations under control therefore a larger more resource and labour intensive program is needed.",

Simply assessing the above-ground plant species richness can provide a very misleading measure of plant biodiversity at a site because much of this diversity is usually only present as dormant seeds in the soil seed bank. We propose to design and implement protocols to sample the soil seed bank in a range of arid zone habitats in a large conservation reserve that has recently been de-stocked and thus to provide realistic assessments of plant diversity that will enable a far more efficient implementation of management actions for revegetation.",
