This branch is created to update the some value types in ecodata for to resolved download xlsx. To resolved some issue while downloading using grails3 in reporting server.

For the Document domain object - I have added Date dateTaken field. To support the grails3 I have added a dateTaken field into the document object in dev branch.

In the database we are currently saving dateTaken field as in String format. I have written a script that changes string date to Date format.

For Score domain object,  currently Score _Id is stored as Long format. Since in grails3 we have change that to ObjectId. So I have changed the from Long id to Object id
Even for that I have added a script to convert Long id to Object Id.
other scripts update the Types of the object. eg. Double to Int, Undefined Value to null
You may need to require to run the updateValueTypesToSupportDownload.js script to update the database.
