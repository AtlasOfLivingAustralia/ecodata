  [mailto:MERIT@environment.gov.au](MERIT@environment.gov.au)’. \

fielddata.about.text=The Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement Tool (MERIT) was developed by the \
  [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au) in 2013 in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.\
 \n \n \
 For grant recipients, MERIT provides a simple user interface for reporting on NRM projects funded by the Australian \
 Government. MERIT allows for a simpler and more complete project record, and can show a direct link between project \
 activities and regional or national biodiversity conservation. \
 \n \n \
 For the Australian Government, MERIT provides greater transparency, increased efficiencies and the ability to use \
 project data for more comprehensive reporting of NRM programme achievements. MERIT also provides the opportunity \
 for public learning within the NRM community through access to a broad range of project and programme information. \
 MERIT was released in December 2013, but will continue to be refined and updated based on user feedback to make \
 the system easier to use and relevant to more people. \
 \n \n \
 At this stage, MERIT will be used for reporting for projects funded under the following previous NRM programmes: \
 \n \n \
* Caring for our Country Target Area Grants \n\
* Caring for our Country Regional Delivery \n\
* Caring for our Country Reef Rescue \n\
* Caring for our Country Community Environment Grants \n\
* Biodiversity Fund Round 1 \n\
* Biodiversity Fund Round 2 \n\
* Biodiversity Fund Investing in Tasmania's Native Forests \n\
* Biodiversity Fund Northern Australia Targeted Investment
fielddata.description.text=The online monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement tool (MERIT) is now \
available for grant recipients to start reporting. \
MERIT has been developed for the project and programme reporting requirements of Australian Government NRM programmes. \
\n\n \
MERIT allows grant recipients to record and upload data about the progress of their projects on a continual basis and to \
submit reports online. It will also increase information sharing within NRM communities and the broader public. \
\n\n \
Developed in collaboration with the [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au), MERIT will enhance the reporting \
process by allowing simpler yet more complete project records and showing direct links between project activities and \
contributions to Australia’s biodiversity conservation work.
fielddata.news.text=##News\n\nThe Department is manually transferring activity schedules from Word document versions of each project \
MERI plan into MERIT. There are quite a few MERI plans that have not been finalised for a range of reasons. Any outstanding \
MERI plans at the release of MERIT will mean that no reporting framework will exist for that project in MERIT, although \
project shells with basic project details will exist. This situation relates to how the system is designed and the \
fact we are not using a one size fits all approach to how projects are monitoring. MERI plans will be progressively \
uploaded to MERIT shortly after they are approved by the Department. \
\n\n \
Grant recipients will also be able to attach their project MERI plans in MERIT to ensure the project activity schedule \
is supported by the other components of the MERI plan. In future these components will transition across to MERIT. \
It is also important to remember that grant recipients will be subject to the normal Departmental arrangements if/when MERI plans are changed.
fielddata.help.text=User guides, online tutorials and frequently asked questions (FAQ) are available here to assist you with using MERIT.
fielddata.contacts.text=### MERIT enquiries \n\n \

officer for general MERI plan and reporting questions.\
